# Machine_learning_pill_identifyer
Making a smart phone able to identify pills through machine learning and without the need to be connected to the Internet. This is not an app nor is it a web page. It is a machine learning model used on a smart phone that does not have to be connected to the internet.

My mother was my inspiration behind my PhD dissertation topic when she said (15 years ago), "My phone is so important to me even though I don't know how to use it". That resulted in my dissertation and research of older adults' uses of technology.

I still have this interest and believe that technology can greatly enhance quality of life issues in older adults. And now, almost 2 decades later, I'm diving into deep learning/ machine learning / artificial intelligence. I'm especially interested in this tech being used on edge devices. Edge devices can be things like smart phones (NOT connected to the interenet), smart watches, Raspberry Pi's and other "smaller computers" that don't need to always be connected to the Internet or working through a cloud in order to do computational work. They keep the data and tech at "the edge". 

I've taken many bootcamps to update my skills on Python and it's relevant libraries (e.g. Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, etc.). Most of them include a lot of theory and few real-world application examples. Most have you use a jupyter notebook to develop your code, and I appreciate that. It gets you to understand the nuts and bolts of something. But hard core code is not always necessary and recently I've started learning how to use Edge Impulse, which provides a gui and front end to producing edge machine learning. That's huge! 

Also, an online Coursera course taught by Shawn Hymel entitled Computer Vision with Embedded Machine Learning helped me learn how to use Edge Impulse. One of the project Shawn demoed was classifying electronic images he took. I'm using that idea for this project, which is, again, inspired by my mother.

My mom takes over 20 pills a day. Most have to do with her having strokes, diabetes, cancer and other health-related issues. She told me that after she organizes the pills into groups to take each day, she can't identify most of the pills. I had my light bulb idea moment!

So this respository contains the files I'm using to build a smart phone machine learning pill identifyer to process and work on the edge.
